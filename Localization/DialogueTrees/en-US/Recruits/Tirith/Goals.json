As their legions attacked, our goddess sat atop her spire at the ciy's center, meaning the invaders tore through our city just to reach her... I know not how many died that day, but I had become trapped in the rubble... That's where I was found and saved." } ],

If my memory serves, she was one of three to claim the souls of some infamous trio of dragons. Hers held the aspect of Power, but I can't recall the other two... After her ascension, she founded our city where she became quite famous as a judge of sorts. Those with disputes would far and wide to our humble city just for her decree on the matter. Though in the end, she died by the Godseeker's hand... A deserved end if you ask me." } ],
