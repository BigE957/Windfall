You may think we're out of luck without the Dragon King, but fear not, there's another entity I know of that might allow us to harness this power: the self-appointed \"Empress of Light\"." } ]

She's a graceless despot; same as the Gods. As such, I'm tasking you with slaying her. She is nothing compared to the might Dragon King, and because of this, I doubt she wields that power all on her own. I'm hopeful you'll discover the method by which she harnesses Primordial Light during your encounter with her. That is, if you're willing to face her?" } ],
