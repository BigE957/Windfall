You may think we're out of luck without the Dragon King, but fear not, there's another entity I know of that might allow us to harness this power: the self-appointed \"Empress of Light\"." } ]

How she of all beings came to wield the Dragon King's power is beyond my understanding, but I'm hopeful you'll discover the method by which she harnesses Primordial Light during your battle with her. That is, if you're willing to face her?" } ],
