Y'know... robes, hoods, masks... all the good stuff! I'll assign you a specific piece of clothing and give you the materials to make it. All the work stations you'll need to do that are all right here. Once you're done, you bring it back to me, and I give you another. So on and so forth until we've met our quota for the night. Got it?",
