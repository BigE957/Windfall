LoreBraelor:
	'''
	I am not surprised to see Braelor alive. If any could survive that nightmarish dimension it would no doubt be he. 
	Once renowned as a mighty hero, Braelor was one of two tasked by the Archons to put an end to my conquest. 
	He served Silva as her champion, and was an inspiration to all who fought at his side. 
	There was a time I once thought his persona a facade, however upon meeting him in battle, that notion was quickly corrected. 
	As our blades met, I felt a true passion behind his strikes, that he believed his cause was absolute and just. 
	Facing down the two of them was the first time I had felt truly challenged. That feeling was� Exhilarating. 
	If not for that Wyrm, I�d have been killed that day. In all honesty, a part of me wishes it had held back�
